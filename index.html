                my time at university: it is really nice to study,
                the students are very friendly and ready to help.
                The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there
                every time. I like to receive and deal with challenging
                tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think

                </h2>
                <p class="wow zoomInUp text-secondary" data-wow-duration="1.4s">
                    Willpower taught at Stanford! This course is incredibly
                    popular among students - everyone wants to strengthen willpower.
                    But so far there has not been a teacher who would undertake
                    to take a science-based course on this topic, dig up other
                    people's research and conduct his own. Everything to prove
                    that we train this skill and teach everyone who wants it to
                    develop. <br>
                    This teacher was a psychologist, Ph.D. Kelly McGonigal
                    - who subsequently wrote The Willpower Instinct, which
                    we published under the title Willpower. It was she who
                    brought the idea of ​​the will-training course to the
                    campus of business school No. 1 in the world, developed
                    it and continues to this day, receiving gratitude
                    from students and many teaching awards.<br>
                    What caught us in the book: <br>
                    It turned out that willpower can be trained
                    like muscles. The more you train, the easier
                    it is to use. The position “I work on the
                    task for 10 minutes and then I can quit”,
                    oddly enough, greatly increases the
                    chances of completing the case. Sleep
                    and rest in the most direct way
                    strengthen willpower, and stress
                    reduces it. The fact is that a
                    tense organism does its best to direct
                    us to pleasure, even dubious in terms
                    of long-term goals.

                    "Samurai without a sword"
                </h2>
                <p class="wow zoomInUp text-secondary" data-wow-duration="1.4s">
                    Japanese wisdom and philosophy are particularly attractive;
                    many people in European countries turn to Eastern teachings
                    in difficult times. The book "Samurai without a sword",
                    written by Kitami Masao, tells about the philosophy of the
                    famous historical figure of Japan of the 16th century
                    Toyotomi Hideyoshi. It is written as if he himself shares
                    his thoughts, which allows him to be even more inspired
                    by his ideas. The narrative is more like a memoir and an
                    autobiography than a textbook, but it contains a lot of
                    useful information. <br>
                    This book will benefit those who want to achieve
                    their goals, who seek to become a leader. Although
                    Toyotomi Hideyoshi lived in the 16th century, his
                    advice remains relevant in the 21st century. At a
                    time when in Japan power was transferred only through
                    the bloodline, and Toyotomi was from a simple peasant
                    family, he was able to achieve a high post in society. <br>
                    He became a leader and was able to unite a country
                    that was in a difficult situation at that time.
                    Toyotomi became a samurai, as he dreamed of as a
                    child, only he defended his beliefs and the interests
                    of his country not with the help of the sword, but with
                    the power of reason, his wisdom. That is why the book has
                    such a name. <br>
                    The author tells how to behave in difficult situations,
                    how to build relationships with colleagues and motivate
                    subordinates. The book provides food for thought and
                    information on how to learn to solve all issues peacefully,
                    thanks to wisdom and a special type of thinking.
